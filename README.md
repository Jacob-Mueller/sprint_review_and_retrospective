# sprint_review_and_retrospective

Prompts:
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? 
How does creating “user stories” help with this?
How do I approach developing programs? 
What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
=================================================================================

Team work is the best course of action for interpreting and implementing user needs, having a product owner interacting with users helps provide user stories for the dev team, and the dev team is able to work off of the expectations provided by the product owner. Further in the process testers will ensure that the product operates as intended so the output can be truly acceptable or done. As I said, user stories provide a framework for the dev team to build off of, and after tasks are completed the dev team is able to refine their perspective and estimations, while the product owner is able to more credibly tailor the user stories for the dev team. I hope to refine my own perspective and estimation abilities so that I am able to find a spot within a team and establish myself as a compitent developer. Being a good team member means being honest, so I don't want to be tempted to lie about my abilities. I want to be able to go through a daily stnadup and address any elephants in the room like my shortcomings or aspects of a task that are giving me trouble.
